Cognify is an **Adaptive AI Mentor, Pedagogical Diagnostic Engine & Assistive Platform** developed by the **Cognify Development Team** to empower students, self-learners, and people of determination (individuals with visual, hearing, or motor disabilities).

Unlike conventional LLM wrappers that treat every query as a stateless prompt, Cognify maintains a **continuous, evidence-based pedagogical state**. It detects learning strain in real time, diagnoses root-cause prerequisite gaps, optimizes instructional strategies dynamically across 5 modalities, and guards against memory decay using active spaced micro-retrieval.

## 📌 The Problem
Most AI educational tools and chatbots suffer from four fundamental flaws:
1. **Stateless Instruction**: The model does not learn *how* the student learns; every session restarts from scratch.
2. **Cognitive & Jargon Mismatch**: Beginners are overwhelmed by abstract jargon, while advanced students receive superficial answers.
3. **Fragile Accessibility**: Standard interfaces exclude students with visual, hearing, motor, or speech impairments.
4. **Longitudinal Forgetting**: Students learn a concept today but experience memory decay over weeks without structured micro-retrieval.

---

## 🚀 The Cognify Solution
Cognify bridges these gaps with a closed-loop, evidence-based learning cycle:
- **Trilingual Core**: Native fluency in **Arabic** (Egyptian & Modern Standard), **English**, and **French**.
- **Pedagogical Decoupling**: Academic levels and cognitive scaffolding are driven strictly by **observed concept mastery and empirical evidence**, completely decoupled from static IQ metrics.
- **Server-Side AI Gateway**: Master provider API keys remain strictly on the server (`api/` serverless functions); client browsers **never** touch master AI keys.
- **Privacy Sovereignty**: Zero-knowledge edge vision processing, owner-only conversation isolation, full GDPR/FERPA data export, and self-erasure.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence Architecture (Plan 3)

```text
Student Interaction (Chat / Formative Check / Video / Speech)
       │
       ▼
1. Persistent Learning Event Store (src/lib/learningEvents.ts)
   - Emits events on in-memory Event Bus
   - Persists append-only logs to Firestore (users/{uid}/learningEvents/{eventId})
       │
       ▼
2. Unified Student State Engine (src/lib/studentStateEngine.ts)
   - Evaluates response latency, error streaks, and learning strain
   - Updates concept mastery & SM-2 retention schedules
   - Hydrates deterministically from event history
       │
       ▼
3. Concept Graph & Remedial Diagnosis (src/lib/conceptGraph.ts)
   - Traverses knowledge nodes & directed prerequisite edges
   - Diagnoses foundational blockers (e.g., struggling with "dynamic_memory" stems from "pointers")
       │
       ▼
4. Server-Side AI Gateway & Dynamic Persona (api/_lib/)
   - Authenticates Firebase JWT Bearer tokens (authGuard.ts)
   - Deterministic, zero-token router classifies task category (router.ts)
   - Injects real-time student state, cognitive stage, and pedagogy directives (ai.ts)
   - Quality Guard sanitizes output and validates code blocks (qualityGuard.ts)
       │
       ▼
5. True Adaptive Tutor Loop (Active Feedback & Spaced Retrieval)
   - Real-time Conversational Strain Detection & Pedagogy Auto-Pivot
   - Formative 1-Click Micro-Checkups with prerequisite interleaving
   - Active Spaced Micro-Retrieval (SuperMemo SM-2)
   - Pedagogical Strategy Efficacy Matrix (Empirical Win-Rate Scoring)
       ↺ (Closed Loop)
```

## ✨ Key Feature Modules

### 1. Adaptive Learning & Mentorship
- **Live Conversational Strain Engine**: Detects confusion, hesitation, or simplification requests in real time and automatically pivots instructional strategies (e.g., from *Socratic* to *Step-by-Step Scaffolding* or *Visual Analogies*).
- **Formative 1-Click Micro-Checkups**: Interactive comprehension checks embedded seamlessly in chat, measuring response latency in milliseconds and linking misconceptions to prerequisite reviews.
- **Active Spaced Micro-Retrieval (SM-2)**: Proactively prompts 30-second refresher checks when concepts reach their forgetting curve interval ($1d \to 3d \to 7d \to 14d+$).
- **Pedagogical Strategy Efficacy Matrix**: Empirically scores which of the 5 instructional modalities (Scaffolded, Analogies, Worked Examples, Socratic, Deep Rigor) produces the highest comprehension for each learner.
- **Normalized Gain Evaluation**: Uses Hake's normalized gain equation ($g = \frac{Post - Pre}{100 - Pre}$) to measure actual knowledge transfer between pre- and post-assessments.

### 2. Multi-Modal Accessibility Suite
- **Vision Companion (Blind & Low-Vision)**: Real-time scene, text, and hazard narration. All camera frames are processed in volatile memory and **never written to disk or cloud (0% Disk / 0% Cloud)**.
- **Spatial Memory Engine**: Localizes and tracks physical objects (keys, eyeglasses, canes) across rooms with chronological surface history (last 10 surfaces) and epistemic honesty (never hallucinates an unobserved item).
- **Sign Avatar 3D (Deaf & Hard of Hearing)**: Real-time 3D signing avatar powered by Three.js and custom sign pose translation.
- **Two-Way Hearing Bridge**: Live bilingual speech-to-text transcription with adjustable font sizes and high-contrast styling.
- **Motor Euphonia & Switch Access**: Minimal-motor single-switch interface, dwell clickers, and high-contrast navigation for motor-impaired learners.
- **Speech Sanitizer**: Natural voice filtering in TTS engine (`cleanForSpeech`), removing markdown noise, asterisks, and robotic labels before audio synthesis.

### 3. Academic Command Center & Analytics
- **Academic Planner**: Interactive semester schedule, assignments, and exam calendars.
- **GPA Calculator**: Multi-scale (4.0 and 5.0) cumulative GPA simulator with isolated "What-If" scenario planning.
- **Cognitive Gym**: Daily logic exercises, pattern recognition challenges, and streak tracking.
- **Student Privacy Center**: Full data sovereignty with one-click GDPR/FERPA JSON export (v2.0.0) and cascading account erasure.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Domain | Technologies |
|---|---|
| **Frontend UI** | React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, Motion, Lucide Icons, Recharts, react-markdown |
| **Serverless Backend** | Node.js (Vercel Serverless `/api`), Express (`server.ts` for local development & self-hosting) |
| **Authentication & Database** | Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore (multi-database isolation), Firebase Storage |
| **AI Foundation Engine** | Server-side multi-provider router: Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`), Groq, NVIDIA NIM, xAI |

## 🔐 Environment Variables & Security Configuration

Server-side API keys are read by `/api/` serverless functions at request time and are **NEVER sent to the client browser**.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see `.env.example`):

```bash
# ── Server-Side Keys (Private - Never Exposed to Browser) ───────────────────────
# Google Gemini API key(s) (supports rotation with comma-separated keys)
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy_your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional Fallback Providers
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_key_here
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-your_nvidia_key_here
XAI_API_KEY=xai-your_xai_key_here

# ── Client-Side Variables (Publicly Inlined by Vite) ───────────────────────────
# Optional error monitoring
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in Production**: In Cognify 2.0, production AI requests are handled exclusively through serverless endpoints (`/api/gemini/chat`, `/api/gemini/generate`). Client-side BYOK keys entered by users are encrypted via Web Crypto API AES-GCM before storage.

## 🚢 Deployment

Cognify is optimized for deployment on **Vercel** with zero configuration:
1. Connect your repository to Vercel.
2. In **Project Settings → Environment Variables**, add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` (and optional `GROQ_API_KEY` / `NVIDIA_API_KEY`).
3. Deploy! Vercel automatically deploys the frontend static assets and provisions the serverless endpoints under `/api`.
